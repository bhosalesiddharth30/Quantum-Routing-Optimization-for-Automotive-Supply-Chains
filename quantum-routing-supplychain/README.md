# Quantum Routing Optimization for Automotive Supply Chains

This project demonstrates the use of quantum computing (via QAOA) to solve supply chain routing problems in the automotive sector. It compares quantum results with classical baselines like Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features
- Medium-sized graph with suppliers and customers
- QUBO formulation using Qiskit
- Solved with QAOA and compared to Dijkstra
- Route visualization with NetworkX

## Technologies
- Python, Qiskit, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Pandas

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Open `notebooks/main.ipynb`
2. Follow the notebook instructions step-by-step

## Project Keywords
Quantum Computing, Quantenalgorithmen, Optimization, Parallel Computing, GPU Acceleration, Strategic Thinking, Vehicle Optimization, Energy Efficiency
